# Python Projects 
---
In this repository, I will upload mostly games using Pygames. 

The firs game that I code was _Alien Invasion_, based in the code of [Python Crash Course](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1718502702?ref=emc_s_m_5_i_atc) from  Eric Matthes. 

For the second games I was thinking about a game that I saw on the series _Fallout_. In the first episode, Norm was playing a game in his _Pip-Boy_ similar to [Missile Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command).

## [Alien Invasion](https://github.com/EnzoRg/python-projects/tree/main/alien_invasion)

## Missile Command (I should change tha name)
